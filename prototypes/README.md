# Prototypes & UI Concepts

**Status:** Placeholder — add links as prototypes are created.

## What Goes Here

Links to clickable prototypes, UI demos, design mockups, and the reasoning behind UX decisions. Not source files (those live in code repos) — references and context.

### Format

When adding a prototype, include:

```markdown
## [Name] — [Date]

**Link:** [URL to prototype/demo]
**What it shows:** Brief description
**Key decisions:** What UX choices were made and why
**Status:** Active / Superseded / Archived
```
