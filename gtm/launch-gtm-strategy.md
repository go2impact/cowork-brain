# Cowork.ai — Launch & Go-to-Market Strategy

**v1.1 — February 12, 2026**
**Purpose:** How we get Cowork.ai into workers' hands, then onto employers' desks, then into enterprises. In weeks and months, not years.

---

## Why Now (and Not 6 Months Ago)

This product was technically impossible 90 days ago. Three things converged simultaneously:

**MCP became real.** The Model Context Protocol gave AI agents a standardized way to see and act on local data — Slack, Gmail, Zendesk, local files — without brittle custom integrations. Before MCP, building an agent that could draft IN Zendesk (not just suggest text to copy-paste) required reverse-engineering every platform. Now it's a protocol.

**Local reasoning models work.** DeepSeek-R1 running on consumer hardware can actually think through a CX ticket with contradictory customer replies. Six months ago, local models were autocomplete. Now they reason. That's what makes the $0 operating cost for daily work possible.

**Cloud inference costs collapsed.** Frontier-quality cloud AI dropped 80%+ in cost over the past few months. Subsidizing a free work week for a user costs ~$0.46/month. In 2024, that same experience would have cost $5-10/user/month — too expensive to give away at scale.

Any one of these alone wouldn't be enough. All three together means we can ship a product where 70% of the AI runs free on the user's machine, the other 30% costs us less than a dollar a month, and the agent actually does useful work inside their real tools. That window is open right now.

## The Distribution Advantage

Most AI startups spend $50-100 to acquire a single user. We spend the cost of an email send.

### What We Have

**2M+ verified remote worker profiles.** Everyone who has applied for a job through Go2 over 8 years. These aren't scraped emails — these are people who submitted full applications with CVs, employment history, software proficiency, and hardware specs.

**Hardware specs on file.** Every applicant submits their machine specs as part of the Go2 application. We can filter for 16GB+ RAM, Apple Silicon, specific OS versions. We know exactly who can run the full local experience before we ever reach out.

**Deep professional context.** We have their CVs. We know what tools they use (Zendesk, Salesforce, Intercom, Freshdesk). We know their job titles, experience level, English proficiency, typing speed. The personalization potential for outreach is extreme — we can write emails that feel hand-picked because they functionally are.

**~250K LinkedIn followers.** Filipino remote worker audience. Organic reach for product announcements without ad spend.

**1,000+ new applicants per day.** Continuous inflow of people actively looking for remote work opportunities. These are high-intent — they're trying to improve their earning potential, which is exactly what Cowork.ai does.

**Go2 enterprise pipeline.** ~$10M/year in staffing revenue pipeline. Thousands of businesses in HubSpot with documented pain points, platform preferences, and worker performance data. When we're ready for B2B, the leads already exist.

**51 countries.** Not just the Philippines. Latin America, India, Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia. Wherever people work remotely for international clients, we have applicants.

### Why This Matters

We're not cold-emailing strangers. We're reaching out to people who already know the Go2 brand, who applied because they wanted better remote work opportunities, and who we know enough about to make the outreach genuinely relevant. "Based on your experience with Intercom and your MacBook specs, you're a fit for our local AI pilot" isn't spam — it's a personalized invitation backed by real data.

## Three Phases: Workers → Businesses → Enterprise

### Phase 1: Direct to Workers (Build the product WITH users)

**Timeline:** Weeks, not months.
**Goal:** Get the product into the hands of workers who will have the best experience, learn from their usage, and build real proof that this works.

**Who first:** Filter the Go2 database for Apple Silicon, 16GB+ RAM. These users get the full local brain (DeepSeek-R1 on-device) + free cloud allocation. The product feels fast, free, and private. No compromises on hardware. Even if the first cohort is 10 people, they need to have a flawless experience.

**Who next:** Expand to broader Mac users, then 8GB machines (cloud-only mode). Each ring outward is a slightly more constrained experience, but by then we have usage data, workflow rules, and testimonials from the first cohort.

**The pitch to workers:** Not "productivity tool." Capacity. "AI is going to change your job whether you like it or not. Use it first, on your terms, with your data staying on your machine. Handle more volume, take on more clients, earn more money."

These are people who applied to Go2 because they need income and opportunity. We're offering exactly that — just through software instead of a job placement.

**Why workers first (not their employers):**
- Workers who choose the tool themselves actually use it. Top-down deployments get resisted.
- Workers who see real ROI ($10/month → $200/month more earnings) become advocates. They'll tell coworkers. Some will push their employers to adopt it company-wide.
- We learn what actually matters in real CX workflows before we ever pitch a business.
- Workers on remote machines make their own software decisions. No IT department blocking installs.

**Waitlist as growth engine.** We can't email 2M people on day one — cloud costs alone would be catastrophic. The waitlist controls burn rate while creating viral pull. Referrals from existing users (and especially from paid users) skip the queue: "Refer 3 coworkers to move up." This turns a cost-control mechanism into worker-to-worker distribution that bypasses management entirely.

**What we learn in Phase 1:**
- Is DeepSeek-R1 8B actually good enough for daily CX work?
- What's the real local vs cloud usage split?
- Which workflow rules emerge most quickly?
- What's the actual free-to-paid conversion rate?
- Where does the product break?

### Phase 2: Sell to Businesses (The Go2 Flip)

**Timeline:** Once Phase 1 proves the product works in the wild.
**Goal:** Take the same tool and sell it to the businesses who hire remote workers.

**The audience already exists.** Go2 has sold $60M+ in staffing services to SMBs over 8 years. We have thousands of business relationships, documented in HubSpot, with detailed records of their pain points, platforms, and worker performance issues. We know what breaks in their operations because we've staffed those operations.

**The pitch to businesses:** "Your best remote workers are already more productive than you think. Give your whole team the same advantage. Per-seat pricing, your SOPs baked in, consistent quality across every agent."

**Pricing shift:** Individual workers pay $10-50/month out of their own pocket because the ROI is obvious to them personally. Businesses pay $100-400/seat/month because the value proposition is different — it's consistency, training cost reduction, and operational leverage across a team. The business isn't buying a tool for one person; they're buying a quality floor for every worker.

**The Go2 transition:** Yes, this eventually competes with Go2's staffing model. That's the point. If a business can get 2x output from their existing team with Cowork.ai, they don't need to hire 2x the people through Go2. We'd rather own that transition than have someone else disrupt us. The software business is higher-margin, more scalable, and doesn't require managing 1,000+ employees across 51 countries.

### Phase 3: Enterprise (Figure it out when we get there)

**Timeline:** After Phase 2 proves the B2B model.
**Goal:** Large-scale deployments, data analytics layer, workforce intelligence platform.

We've historically struggled with enterprise sales. That's where the largest value prop is (standardized AI across thousands of workers, behavioral analytics, workforce optimization), but the sales cycle is long and the requirements are complex. We'll figure out the enterprise play once Phase 1 and 2 give us the product maturity, case studies, and revenue base to compete credibly.

What we know now: enterprise will care about data governance, SSO, admin controls, usage analytics, and SOP enforcement. Build for that when we get there, not before.

## Speed

This needs to move in weeks and months. The technological window (local reasoning + MCP + cheap cloud) is open now, but it won't stay open for long. Every major AI company is building agents. Our advantage isn't technology — it's distribution. We have the emails, the professional context, and the brand trust to get this into workers' hands faster than anyone else can. But only if we move before the market catches up.

Phase 1 doesn't require a perfect product. It requires a working product in the hands of users who can tell us what's broken. The Go2 database means we can find those users tomorrow — we don't need to wait for organic growth or paid acquisition.

## Messaging by Channel

| Channel | Narrative | Goal |
|---------|-----------|------|
| **Direct email** (Go2 database) | "Based on your profile and specs, you're a fit for our AI pilot." | High-conversion onboarding. Feels hand-picked, not mass-blasted. |
| **LinkedIn** (250K followers) | Worker advocacy. Anti-burnout. ROI stories from real users. | Organic brand awareness and trust. Zero ad spend. |
| **In-app** (active users) | "You handled 1.4x more tickets this week. Imagine 2x." | Upsell from free → Boost → Pro. Show the math in their own data. |
| **B2B outreach** (Go2 pipeline) | "Your team's best performers are already using AI. Standardize it." | Convert staffing leads to software seats. |
| **Waitlist comms** | "You're on the list. Refer 3 coworkers to skip ahead." | Viral growth without ad spend. Controls cloud burn. |

The in-app channel matters as much as external marketing. Once someone is using Cowork.ai, the product itself is the best sales pitch — surface their own productivity data and make the upgrade math obvious.

## What This Doc Doesn't Cover

- **Tier pricing and cost economics:** See [strategy/llm-strategy.md](../strategy/llm-strategy.md)
- **Technical architecture (models, routing, hardware):** See [architecture/llm-architecture.md](../architecture/llm-architecture.md)
- **Email templates, ad copy, content calendar:** Not in this repo. This doc is strategy and logic, not execution assets.
- **Specific campaign plans:** TBD as Phase 1 launches. Will add channel-specific playbooks as they're developed.

## Open Questions

1. **Outreach sequencing.** How many users in the first cohort? 50? 500? 5,000? Need to balance learning speed against support capacity and cloud costs.
2. **Employer risk.** Some workers' employment contracts restrict unauthorized software. How prominently do we disclose this? We're transparent about what the tool does, but we're not their legal advisor.
3. **Go2 brand vs Cowork brand.** Do we reach out as Go2 ("you applied with us") or as Cowork.ai ("new product from the Go2 team")? Different trust signals.
4. **Phase 2 timing.** When do we flip from "workers choose this" to "employers buy this"? Too early and we don't have proof. Too late and we miss the window where workers are already advocating internally.
5. **International considerations.** 51 countries means 51 sets of data privacy rules. Phase 1 can focus on Philippines (where we have deepest presence), but scaling requires legal review per market.
