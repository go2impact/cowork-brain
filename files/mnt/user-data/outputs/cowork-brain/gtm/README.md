# Go-to-Market & Distribution

**Status:** Placeholder — strategy to be built out.

## Distribution Assets (What We Already Have)

These are Cowork.ai's inherited advantages from Go2's 8-year operation. No other AI productivity tool launching today has this.

### Direct-to-Worker Channels
- **~1M email subscribers** — Go2's applicant and worker database. Opt-in, engaged, already trust the brand.
- **~250K LinkedIn followers** — Filipino remote worker audience. Organic reach for product announcements.
- **Sourcing team** — Can deploy Cowork into targeted channels immediately (freelancer communities, remote work groups, BPO networks).

### Enterprise / B2B Channels
- **Go2 client base** — Existing businesses already paying for remote workers. Natural upsell: "Put Cowork on your workers' machines, they become 2x productive."
- **Go2 leads pipeline** — Businesses that inquired but didn't convert on staffing. New conversation: "Don't hire through us — just give your existing remote team this tool."

### Product-Led Channels
- **Hardware-qualified user base** — We know enough about our worker population to segment by machine specs. Target 16GB+ Mac users first with: "You qualify for the full local AI experience. Try it free, we'll cover X tokens."
- **Built-in referral mechanics** — Paid users get priority activation for their referrals (from waitlist system).

## Phased Rollout (Sketch)

### Phase 1: Workers Direct
Go to the workers, not their employers. Filipino CX agents, VAs, and remote workers who pay for their own tools. Free tier proves value, paid tiers scale with their earnings.

### Phase 2: Enterprise Push
Sell to businesses to deploy on worker machines. Per-seat pricing. Worker gets Boost tier included, pays personally for Pro/Max upgrades if they want more.

### Phase 3: Platform
Cowork becomes the distribution layer for AI-augmented remote work. Workers bring their Cowork profile (workflow rules, performance data, skills) to new clients. Data portability as competitive moat.

## Open Questions

- What's the activation campaign for the email list? Segmentation strategy?
- LinkedIn content plan — product demos, worker testimonials, ROI stories?
- Sourcing team deployment — which communities first, what's the pitch?
- Enterprise pricing model — per-seat flat rate vs usage-based?
- How do we handle workers whose employers restrict software installation?
